### Some Important notes:

- Please know that I use python venv while doing this. There might be differences with your installed library. Although this project is straighforward, it should not cause much issue.
- All you need for the dependencies library is in the requirements.txt

### How to install: 
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### How to use: 
PLEASE NOTE: it needs 1 command after the filename! 
```
python app.py
```
or
```
python3 app.py
```
